== Installing ==
gegl-gtk uses an autotools build system. To install do:
 ./autogen.sh (from git) or ./configure (from tarball)
 make
 make install

To install to a custom prefix, pass --prefix to autogen.sh/configure. Example:
 ./autogen.sh --prefix=/home/user/gegl-gtk

gegl-gtk uses pkg-config to find its dependencies, set PKG_CONFIG_PATH to
configure which dependencies it is built against.

== Using ==
To use gegl-gtk in your project from C, use the provided pkg-config file
 pkg-config gegl-gtk2-0.1 --libs --cflags

gegl-gtk also has GObject Introspection support, and can be used from
languages like Python, Vala and Javascript.

== Documentation ==
See this file, the examples and source code, for now. :)

== Contributing ==
To contribute code, please file a bug and attach git-formatted patches there, or link to
a public git branch which has the commits (on github for instance).
For quick, simple and obvious fixes, you may send a patch to the mailinglist.

For a list of tasks that needs to be done see the TODO section of this document,
and the TODO, FIXME and XXX comments in the source code.

== TODO ==
Currently the focus is on the 0.1.0 release. The 0.1 series will
have a basic set of features, and maintain ABI and API compatability.

=== 0.1.0 ===
First release. Goal: minimally useful, solid interfaces.
Should at happen before or together with the next Gegl release.
Need to build and work with whatever is the latest Gegl release.

* Sanitize coding style
* API review, check naming
* Complete API documentation
* Simple examples for all provided features

* Register display operation in a generic way with GEGL (needs work in GEGL)
* Display operation needs to spin its own mainloop

* Test bindings. At least using Python and Vala (maybe JavaScript)

(hopefully, can be punted)
* Add API for getting model->view transformation matrix
* Add add support for autoscaling and autocentering
* Add signals for drawing widget background and overlay
* Tests for transformations

=== Later ===
General
* Write a Gegl based GdkPixbuf loader plugin
* API documentation build

GeglView
* Add rotation support

== BUGS ==
* On first redraw of GeglGtkView, there is sometimes a segfault inside babl:
babl-fish-reference.c:290 process_same_model()
